First year "Introduction to web development" module 
Detail of the task
In this assignment, you are required to build a dynamic web application using PHP running on the 
Apache Web Server, using the Eclipse PDT IDE as the development environment.  The application 
will be developed as an Eclipse-based PHP project.  
The application is a Game Console Recommendation web site that provides useful information on 
ONE PARTICULAR GAME CONSOLE (you may choose between PS5 or Xbox series X/S) and 
a set of recommended games.  You should also present additional content that is relevant to each 
game, such as providing a personal recommendation score.
Your recommendation score should be used to present an overall ranking of each product.  
You should choose ONE game console from the list above for your site. 
Your web application is expected to provide content on at least TEN individual games available 
on  your  chosen  console  platform.    You  can  choose  any  ten  games,  but  the  content  should  be 
suitable for users of the age 15 or under (no 18+ products).
Examples  of  additional  content  to  accompany  your  recommendation  and  overview  of  the  console 
are multimedia such as images, videos, text.  You may use external embedded content and public 
web APIs such as YouTube, Twitter etc to help provide this content.  
The specific features you are expected to implement as a MINIMUM are stated in the Application 
Requirements section, later in this document.  
The  PHP  application  will  be  using  version  7+  of  this  language.    The  application  is  required  to 
present  the  application  front-end  user  interface  to  the  user  using  a  combination  of  HTML5,  CSS3 
and JavaScript.  The PHP application will be hosted on the web server using the apache web root 
folder  htdocs.    The  user-interface  should  be  dynamically  generated  using  PHP  web  development 
techniques.  
The  web  application  will  be  accessed  via  the  Google  Chrome  web  browser  –  this  is  the  user’s 
Client.  The  client-side  user  interface  should  utilise  the  Bootstrap  3  front-end  framework  to  render 
the HTML5 markup that comprises the content and structure of the site.  
The site should be styled using CSS3 and work with both Mobile and Desktop clients.  You should 
also use Bootstrap-compatible JavaScript frameworks such as JQuery, Bootstrap.js, 
FontAwesome.js  etc  for  the  client-side  behaviours  of  your  application.  You  may  also  incorporate 
any other JavaScript frameworks that you deem useful to the development of your application.
