	  <p>Critic Reviews for Temtem</p>
	  <P>Already highly polished and nailing the essence of the monster catch battler RPG subgenre, Temtem looks set to go from strength to strength on PlayStation 5 if the surprisingly robust state of its early access debut is any indication. </P>

	  <h3>IGN</h3>
	  <p>A bold but incomplete massively-multiplayer take on the creature collection genre.</p>
	  <p>The question at the top of nearly every prospective Temtem player’s mind is, of course, “Is this just a Pokémon MMO?” After spending more than 30 hours roaming this monster-filled archipelago, my answer is “no.” While it clearly borrows quite a bit from Pokémon, Temtem improves upon the creature collecting formula and builds a unique world that makes it an awesome adventure in its own right.</p>

	  <p>Catch ‘Em All on PlayStation</p>
	  <p>If you’ve ever played a Pokemon game, you’ll feel at home with Temtem. After your created character wakes up on the morning of their big day, they set out to be a Temtem tamer. After a discussion with your mom and the professor, you set out alongside your rival to catch new Temtem, battle other tamers, and fight in Dojo battles (gym leaders, essentially) on your way to becoming the greatest tamer of them all. Again, this is all familiar territory to Pokemon fans, but Temtem is striving to differentiate itself by including always-online elements, co-op, and focusing on double battles. </p>
