	  <p>Multiverse of Radness</p>
	  <P>Ratchet and Clank have been doing the whole “saving the universe” thing for quite some time, and their latest adventure, Rift Apart, amusingly acknowledges that right from the start. But the duo’s age doesn’t show at all thanks to an amazing outing – their first new one in nearly a decade – that is a gorgeous and expertly crafted example of what PS5 exclusives can look and play like. And even compared to great work building out a universe for Spider-Man, Rift Apart may be Insomniac’s most emotionally resonant game yet. </P>

	  <p>Overcooked 2 review - a new and improved recipe</p>
	  <p>Rift Apart is a technical showcase, but it's also one of the finest 3D action platformers since Jak and Daxter. Insomniac consistently proves that the Ratchet and Clank series is a wellspring of potential, and they've delivered a complete experience that's as full of heart as it is surprises.</p>

	  <p>Lombax for good</p>
	  <p>If the Earth was in peril from intergalactic invaders and needed a game developer to save its behind, governments across the globe would turn to Insomniac Games. You can practically bank on the Burbank-based developer to deliver top-notch titles these days, and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is no exception. TL;DR: this PlayStation 5 exclusive action platformer is virtually flawless at what it sets out to do.</p>
