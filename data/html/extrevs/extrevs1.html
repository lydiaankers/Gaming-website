	  <h3>IGN</h3>
	  <p>A frantic and inventive co-op game that manages to turn frustration into charm.</p>
	  <P>The sequel to one of my favorite indie games of 2016 follows a familiar loop: a team of chefs cuts food, 
	  cooks food, and serves finished dishes to invaders to save Onion Kingdom – this time from a zombie army of 
	  bread called the Unbread. It doesn’t radically change the formula of the first game and thus retains the 
	  pick-up-and-play mantra of the original to the point where my wife, who doesn’t typically play games, 
	  had no problem jumping in. But there are more interesting variables in the mix this time, and thanks to 
	  those and some wildly inventive kitchens, varied recipes, and online functionality(!) Overcooked 2 is a 
	  ridiculously entertaining party game and a challenging extension of the original. </p>

	  <p>Overcooked 2 review - a new and improved recipe</p>
	  <p> In many ways, playing Overcooked 2 is like returning to a favourite restaurant after a long absence 
	  and ordering what you always used to have. The comfort of familiar, nourishing food is hugely enjoyable, 
	  of course, but it's the sense of coming back to something that's truly special. When playing Overcooked 2 
	  there's a lot more shouting and swearing, but the principle is the same - this sequel is strikingly similar 
	  to the first game, but a few well-chosen additions and refinements breathe new life into one of the best couch 
	  co-op experiences going.</p>

	  <h3>Nintendo Life</h3>
	  <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
	  <p>One of the first titles to truly show off the co-op power of the Switch was 2017's Overcooked, a fun arcade 
	  action game about chefs scrambling to get food orders out the door. Overcooked was a goofy, chaotic, and refreshingly
	   original title that was a wonderful addition to the Switch eShop, so it was unsurprising that the sequel, Overcooked
	    2, was met with considerable fanfare when it was announced at E3 this year. With Overcooked 2, Ghost Town Games 
	    has managed to recapture the magic that made the first game special, while polishing it up with nips and tucks here
	     and there to make for an overall tighter experience, if one a bit thin on new ideas. </p>
