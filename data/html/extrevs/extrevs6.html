	  <p>A remake that breathes exciting new life into a classic (along with some dull filler)..</p>
	  <P>The fact that remakes of both Resident Evil 3 and Final Fantasy 7 arrive just a week apart is pretty incredible, especially because they couldn’t be more different in their approaches as far as a “remake” goes. While RE3 is a mostly faithful modernization of its original, Final Fantasy 7 is less a remake and more a complete reinvention. It swaps turn-based combat with exciting real-time action and expands the first leg of the original story by dozens of hours – including with a bit too much filler and some convoluted new plot points. The long wait for this revival may not be a perfect reunion, but with or without nostalgia in play, it’s still a great JRPG in its own right. </P>

	  <p> Square Enix did an amazing job with the port of FF7 Remake on PC. The game runs like a dream and can exceed the console versions in terms of visuals and performance, with a beefy PC. The keyboard controls are functional, but the game was originally designed with a controller in mind, so there's only so much that can be done in this regard. FF7 Remake on PC is the total package in terms of content and performance, and the people who have waited patiently for the game can be assured that the PC version is a high-quality offering, with a more complete version of the story than what was available in the PS4 version at launch.</p>

	  <p>Its PS5 version realizes the world of Midgar with stunning new detail.</p>
	  <p>Still, these issues are minor ones. On the whole, the PS5 upgrade for Final Fantasy 7 Remake elevates an already phenomenal, beautiful game, making it easier to play and more beautiful to behold. If you've been holding back on checking out FF7R up to now, the PS5 version is the superior way to experience it--and you absolutely should. </p>
