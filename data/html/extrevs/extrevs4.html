	  <p>A wild ride of custom coasters and light economics</p>
	  <p>Planet Coaster is just about everything I could have asked for in a modern resurrection of the theme park sim genre - and then some. A huge diversity of rides and attractions team up with a nearly absurd level of terrain, structure, and coaster customization options so effectively as to beg the question: where did this type of game go for so many years? It’s still far from an interesting economic simulator, and it’s definitely wanting for certain types of buildings, but many of these weaknesses are likely to fade over time thanks to the shrewd inclusion of full mod support. </P>

	  <p>Multiple User reviews</p>
	  <p> Planet Coaster Console Edition is as comfortable in consoles as it was in PC. Everything remains intact, including the extensive management options and almost endless creative possibilities with roller coasters and buildings. It takes time and patience to get used to it, but if you like theme parks the effort will be worth it.</p>

	  <p>Ride it out</p>
	  <p>The business simulation genre is one that had us hooked to our PS1 during our formative years. Despite playing best on the PC, we lost hundreds of hours huddled around a 14” CRT, building amusement resorts in Theme Park and medical complexes in Theme Hospital. Bullfrog’s slogan for these titles at the time was “big business, big fun”, and we loved the mixture of strategy, creativity, and management that they demanded. </p>
