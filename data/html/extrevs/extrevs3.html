	  <p>The road out of Hell was paved in early access.</p>
	  <p> In the ancient Greek myth of Sisyphus, a poor soul is doomed to forever push a boulder uphill without rest. Each time he’d push it up, it would roll back down again and he’d have to start anew. But what if that Herculean climb uphill was actually awesome combat against a randomized variety of enemies as you fight your way out of Hell, with a wide range of godly powers that grow and combine in interesting ways as you progress? And what if, instead of going back to zero, you got a little stronger each time with some help from a colorful cast of allies and enemies who remember each of your attempts?</p>

	  <p>Hades’ review: supergiant’s latest is, quite literally, a god-tier game</p>
	  <P>Hades is god-like, in every sense of the word. It’s attractive, it’s compelling, it’s wrathful (when it wants to be) and it’s got such a gift at getting in your head that you can understand its cult-like reputation amongst gamers and non-gamers alike. Weaving together considered, inspired storytelling with action that could go toe-to-toe even gaming’s most loved roguelite titans, Hades is both exceptional and essential, pitting you as one of the most complete, rounded protagonists you’ll ever meet, rebelling against something he doesn’t even comprehend.</P>

	  <p>The reason to keep coming back to Hades isn't just the thrills you'll get battling through hell</p>
	  <p>The business simulation genre is one that had us hooked to our PS1 during our formative years. Despite playing best on the PC, we lost hundreds of hours huddled around a 14” CRT, building amusement resorts in Theme Park and medical complexes in Theme Hospital. Bullfrog’s slogan for these titles at the time was “big business, big fun”, and we loved the mixture of strategy, creativity, and management that they demanded. </p>
