	  <p>Wedded bliss.</p>
	  <P>A healthy marriage is like the ultimate co-op game: You have to know when to give and take, when to push
	   and pull, and when to talk and when to listen. But most importantly, you must always remember when it’s your
	    turn to take the garbage out - something Hazelight Studios has certainly done during the development of the 
	    almost entirely garbage-free It Takes Two. This utterly superb co-op platformer manages to cram in enough 
	    unique and exhilarating gameplay ideas to give Shigeru Miyamoto a migraine, with not a single dud among them. </P>

	  <h3>The Guardian</h3>
	  <p>If you can ignore all this and concentrate on the experience of playing, It Takes Two is a truly engaging 
	  family adventure that develops into a considerable challenge. The skilful combination of game conventions and 
	  fresh ideas is the real marriage at the heart of this unusual adventure.</p>

	  <h3>Trusted Reviews</h3>
	  <p>Hazelight Studios is back with another co-op based title, but this time tackling a subject that rarely 
	  features in video games</p>
	  <p>It Takes Two excels in so many ways, not only as a competent and engaging co-op platformer, but also as an
	   endearing and thoughtful tale about the realities of marriage, parenting and what it takes to sustain a 
	   relationship. Outside of one scene that feels tonally conflicted with the rest of the game, and some occasional
	    dips in the quality of voice acting, It Takes Two is a triumph that should not be missed. </p>
