
	<p>There are two curtail differences between the two consoles PS5 Digital Edition and the PS5 Standard Edition with the
	 digital edition does not include a disc drive and the section difference being the cost of both consoles with the 
	 standard edition priced at £449.99 and the digital edition priced at £359.99. The disc drive difference can allow 
	 the user to get some games cheaper as typical console games physical editions are slightly cheaper compared to 
	 the digital editions. this means that over time the user may be able to save money by only buying physical editions
	 but this would take a while for it to be worth for the user. The other difference being the retail pricing of the 
	 overall console can make a difference for someone’s choice as there is almost a £100 difference. Overall, choosing
	 between the consoles is personal to the user as someone who prefers the digital edition would need to prefer their
	 games in the digital format instead of the physical as there is no option for the physical copy but the console price 
	 is cheaper with the games being slightly more expensive. On the other hand, the standard edition is for the users who 
	 can use both physical and digital copy’s for their games, with the physical copy’s of the game being cheaper overall.
	 In addition, the standard edition is higher meaning that it may not be ass accessible due to the price.</p>
