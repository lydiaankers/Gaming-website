<p>Rachet and Clank: Rift apart combines the newer graphics of the new generation consomes such as the Play Station 5
with the smooth yet detailed gameplay. Even with the Rachet and Clank series using the story of "saving the universe"
for many of its games, it acknowledges which could be viewed different from person to person. personally i think its amusing yet 
annoying as they havent really changed that use of a sotry yet. The smooth gameplay
allows for the game to feel as if its keeping up to date with current day gameplay and 
graphics even for being such an old game. Overall, Rachet and Clank is a comfy
game fit for younger and older players to both enjoy with the emphasis being on the older generation from my perspective. </p>
