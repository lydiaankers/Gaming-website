<p>Scarlet Nexus is an action role-playing game played from a third-person perspective. Players can assume control of 
either Yuito Sumeragi or Kasane Randall, members of the Other Suppression Force (OSF) who are tasked to defend New Himuka
 from creatures known as the Others.[2] While they are equipped with short-range weapons like a sword, both Yuito and Kasane
  possess the ability of psychokinesis, allowing them to hurl objects and debris at hostile enemies. The protagonist's powers
   can be upgraded through accessing the "brain map", which serves as the game's skill tree.[3] As players progress, they would
    encounter different party members who would assist them in combat.[4] Each companion has their own unique combat abilities,
     which can then be acquired by the protagonists through an ability named "brain link". </p>
