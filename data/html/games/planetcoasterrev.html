<p>Planet Coaster tries to fit in the genres of Minecraft or Second Life 
compared to its previous games as its using more aspects from its sandbox aspect
with similar features to minecraft. Compared to other games with a similar premis, Planet Coaster
is the best in the market with it being the most realistic with its "capitalism simulator" aspects to the game
allowing for higher dificulty and detail for the older players to partake in. By using features similar to other games
allows for the game to have more creative freedom for its players allwoing them to have more 
control of their game and control their own enjoyment.  </p>
