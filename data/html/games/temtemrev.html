<p> Currenly Tem Tem is still in its early access meaning that not all the content for thr game is accessible meaning Temtem is very similar 
to games such as pokemon meaning it looses some origionality due to there not being as much content comapred to a fully finsihed game.
Even being an MMO allows for the flaws of the game to show more due to the lack of content and repetetiveness of the areas and charcaters.
However, the graphical aspect of Temtem is one of the most unique MMOs to be realeasd in the past couple years, let alone be avilible on console.
The bright and complementory colours of the game allow for people of all ages to enkjoy the game due to its child friend looks. Unless you like to watch
a game develop through the years it will be created, this will be the perfect game for you.</p>
