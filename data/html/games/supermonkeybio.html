<p>As in previous Super Monkey Ball games, the objective of the primary game mode is to navigate a monkey in a ball across a 
series of suspended platforms to reach a goal and clear the stage. To do this, the player must tilt the stage to direct the 
ball's movement, utilizing the game's physics to clear obstacles and avoid falling off the edge. Banana Mania features 
recreations of all 300 stages from Super Monkey Ball Deluxe (2005), a compilation release of Super Monkey Ball (2001) 
and Super Monkey Ball 2 (2002). Certain stages have been rebalanced, decreasing their overall difficulty; the original 
versions of these stages can still be played in a new "Original Stage Mode". The Story mode from 2 also returns, now 
utilizing comic-book-style story sequences in place of the animated cutscenes from the original releases,] along with all 
12 multiplayer party games from DX. A handful of new modes have been added to Banana Mania, each of which presents a 
selection of 10 stages from the main game that must be completed in alternate ways. </p>
