<p> This game is one of the best looking games on the new generations consoles such as 
the Play Station 5 as it utilised the higher specs in the system along with the games intiquite 
code within the game. The attention to detail throughout the game allwoing the game to replecate real 
places whilst combining the amazing graphics allows for the  immersivness to capture the player. 
However, i felt the sotry falling behind compared to the other aspects which breaks the emmersivness 
due to the high standards the graphics give the game.</p>
