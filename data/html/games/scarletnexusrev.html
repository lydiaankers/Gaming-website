<p>My first impression of this game is that it looks like the typical "anime game" 
due to its art style with many other games such as Code Vein being a generic and bland game that didnt really capture my interest
even with hours of game time within the game. The combat is dull and the enemy variety is surpisingly small
from being made by a company such as Bandi Namco as it takes away from the player imersivness. The story and characters make up for the 
for the bland gameplay and repeating models used for enemies as the story is very detailed with intriqute conections and stories between 
each character making it for a interetsing story for players to experiacne. </p>
