<p>Overcooked! 2 is a game for 1-4 players. Play solo or team up with friends either local on the couch or online and 
cook up a ton of brand-new recipes. Overcome obstacles such as fire, collapsing floors, overbearing waiters, and floating
 work surfaces. The Onion Kingdom is in peril again but this time, the Onion King himself is to blame. After reading aloud 
 from the fabled Necro-nomnom-icon, he has cooked up a whole new problem in the form of an Undead Bread army called The Unbread.
  Players will need to chop, fry, and bake their way through all-new crazy kitchens to defeat this new foe and save the kingdom
   once more. </p>
