<p>Hades is a very creative rouge-lite game that has a unique yet detailed story 
with the use of greek mythology as well as using the game genres to 
their advantage to strength the stories feeling. Hades allows for the player to
not feel displeased or defeated when returning to the beginning when dying
as there is always something new for the player to look at or interact with it such as character
lines unlocked after reaching a ceartin floor or so much time spent in the game.
Overall, i find this game refreshing yet challenging whilst giving me the freedom to 
create a build that suits my fighting style with 
rouge-lite genres. </p>
