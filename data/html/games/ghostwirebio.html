<p>Ghostwire: Tokyo is an action-adventure game played from a first-person perspective. The player can use various
 psychic and paranormal abilities to defeat the ghosts and spirits haunting Tokyo. Combat director Shinichiro Hara 
 described the combat as "karate meets magic", as the player character utilizes hand movements inspired by Kuji-kiri hand 
 gestures to cast spells. When an enemy loses most of their health, its core is exposed and the player can use takedown 
 moves to destroy it, defeating the spirit. Nearly all of Tokyo's citizens have vanished mysteriously, and Yokai 
 (known as Visitors) have invaded the city. Akito, the game's protagonist, is possessed and saved by a spirit detective
  named KK after a motorcycle accident, who, while having his own agenda, grants him supernatural powers. As Akito combats 
  the Yokai haunting the city, he encounters a group wearing Hannya masks who may unveil the mystery behind the strange 
  events in Tokyo, one of which is the kidnapping of Akito’s sister. </p>
