<p>Cody and May, a married couple, are planning on getting a divorce. After telling their daughter Rose the news, she takes
 her hand-made dolls, which look like her parents, into the family shed and tries to repair their relationship by play-acting.
  The parents find themselves trapped inside the dolls' bodies as a consequence of Rose's tears landing on the dolls. Dr. Hakim,
   who has assumed the anthropomorphic form of his relationship therapy book, tells May and Cody that he has been given the job 
   of trying to fix their relationship as they try to reach Rose. It Takes Two is an action-adventure video game with elements 
   from platform games. It is specifically designed for split-screen cooperative multiplayer, which means that it must be played
    with another player through either local or online play.</p>
