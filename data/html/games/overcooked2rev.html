<p>From my experiance, i find this game to be equally as entertaining as stressfull
when trying to manage the aspects of this game to get the highest score possible. The
small mechanics of this game that just give it its charm and unique aspects somapred 
to other games within this genere such as the throwing mechanic. this mechanic can be 
very useful for multiplayer aspects of the game aswell as allowing for great synchonisation.
In addtion, the story of this game is cute allwoing for a very relaxed experiance making it perfect
for player with friends or alone!</p>
