<p>This game has multiple game modes and over 300 stages being upgraded from the 
previous games int he series, this game has alot of content keeping the users engaged combined with 
the unique and bright colourful graphics. This similarity between the older games allows for the older players
to have that senese of nistolgia allowing for the captivity along with the bright colours attracting a younger 
audience to the game to relive the experiance of the older players. However, with this game having so much
content and revamped levels from previous games allows for levels to feel repetetive and boring. </p>
