<p>Even though Final Fantasy VII Remake had such high, it manages to not even meet, it manages to exceed the expectations with many factors
such as graphics, story and similarity to the origional game. FFVII Remake story will differenciate towards the of the story allowing 
for the old players to reliv their childhood experiance with a new sotry as well as
letting newer players experiance the industry changing game that was the original Final Fantasy VII.
Compared to other games with a similar genre cant match up to any aspect of FFVII Remake with even the old combat
being revamped to have alot of enemy variety keeping the imersivness in their game alive as well as being able to flesh out the 
story arcs that were only glossed over in the origional game. Overall, this game stook the the origional with changed being in the best place possible
and allowing for every player of every to enjoy it. </p>
