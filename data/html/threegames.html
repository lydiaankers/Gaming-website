	  <h3>Final Fantasy VII Remake</h3>
	  <p>Score: 9/10 </p>
	  <P>Even though Final Fantasy VII Remake had such high, it manages to not even meet, it manages to exceed the expectations with many factors
	such as graphics, story and similarity to the origional game. FFVII Remake story will differenciate towards the of the story allowing 
	for the old players to reliv their childhood experiance with a new sotry as well as
	letting newer players experiance the industry changing game that was the original Final Fantasy VII.
	Compared to other games with a similar genre cant match up to any aspect of FFVII Remake with even the old combat
	being revamped to have alot of enemy variety keeping the imersivness in their game alive as well as being able to flesh out the 
	story arcs that were only glossed over in the origional game. Overall, this game stook the the origional with changed being in the best place possible
	and allowing for every player of every to enjoy it. </p>

	  <h3>Overcooked 2</h3>
	  <p>Score: 6/10</p>
	  <p> From my experiance, i find this game to be equally as entertaining as stressfull
		when trying to manage the aspects of this game to get the highest score possible. The
		small mechanics of this game that just give it its charm and unique aspects somapred 
		to other games within this genere such as the throwing mechanic. this mechanic can be 
		very useful for multiplayer aspects of the game aswell as allowing for great synchonisation.
		In addtion, the story of this game is cute allwoing for a very relaxed experiance making it perfect
		for player with friends or alone!.</p>

	  <h3>Rachet and Clank: Rift Apart</h3>
	  <p>Score: 6/10</p>
	  <p>Rachet and Clank: Rift apart combines the newer graphics of the new generation consomes such as the Play Station 5
		with the smooth yet detailed gameplay. Even with the Rachet and Clank series using the story of "saving the universe"
		for many of its games, it acknowledges which could be viewed different from person to person. personally i think its amusing yet 
		annoying as they havent really changed that use of a sotry yet. The smooth gameplay
		allows for the game to feel as if its keeping up to date with current day gameplay and 
		graphics even for being such an old game. Overall, Rachet and Clank is a comfy
		game fit for younger and older players to both enjoy with the emphasis being on the older generation from my perspective. </p>
